RoboDJ Notes
------------

- Play a sound when the ripping process is complete (or when an error
  occurs) because the user may be off doing something in another window

- Catch database errors after the ripping process and allow user to retry
  commit to database after fixing database unavailability.

- Impersonate a registered CDDB client until we can get "approval".

- Have musicd manage the playlist hierarchically so that if we add a whole
  CD to the playlist, we can remove it in the same way. Also pass the
  metadata (entryid, songid) to the musicd as well so that we don't have
  to reverse engineer things when we're displaying the contents of the
  playlist.
